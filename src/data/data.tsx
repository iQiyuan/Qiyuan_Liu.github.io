          For me, control systems and robotic design are more than technical endeavorsâ€”they are keys to realizing the future. 
          From agriculture to healthcare, from industrial automation to everyday human life, these technologies have the potential to reshape how we interact with the world. 
          Currently, as a Master's student at UC Berkeley, I am immersing myself in advanced studies and hands-on projects in robotics and autonomous systems. 
          This environment not only sharpens my technical skills but also expands my perspective on how engineering can address global challenges.

          Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my work at the intersection of control systems and robotic design, constantly pushing the boundaries of technology. 
          By combining theoretical knowledge with real-world needs, I hope to collaborate with like-minded individuals to drive the development of next-generation intelligent systems.

Engineering is not just about optimizing existing technologies but also about the art of solving complex problems. From developing reinforcement learning-controlled robotic arms to designing algorithms for multi-robot task allocation, my work goes beyond the application of tools, focusing instead on the logic and potential behind the systems. Every experience has deepened my understanding that innovation stems not only from technical expertise but also from insight into the essence of a problem. 
  In these projects, I strive not only for efficient and precise solutions but also to infuse greater flexibility and adaptability into the technology, ensuring it serves complex and dynamic scenarios effectively.`,

    description: 'Task allocation is a critical component of multi-robot collaboration. Among various approaches, space partitioning methods based on Voronoi cells (VSP) offer a straightforward and effective way to assign tasks. However, traditional VSP-based task allocation methods often lack adaptability to dynamic changes in tasks and environments. To address this limitation, our model introduces a task allocation algorithm that leverages vehicle-centered Voronoi region partitioning. By dynamically adjusting the weights of Voronoi cells, this method adapts to environmental and task changes in real time. As a result, it achieved a 57.14% increase in task efficiency, and a 21.71% improvement in task distribution balance.',
